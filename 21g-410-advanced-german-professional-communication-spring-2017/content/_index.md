This course exposes students to current issues and language use in German technology, business, and international industrial relations, and discusses ramifications of these issues in a larger social and cultural context. We seek to prepare students who wish to work or study in a German-speaking country by focusing on specialized vocabulary and systematic training in speaking and writing skills to improve fluency and style and emphasizing communicative strategies that are crucial in a working environment. Discussion and analysis of newspaper and magazine articles, modern expository prose, and extensive use of online material are included. Taught in German.
